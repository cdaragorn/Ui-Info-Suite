# UI Info Suite 2
_Ongoing maintenance for the original UI Info Suite mod for Stardew Valley._


UI Info Suite provides helpful information about things around you designed to help you be aware of what's going on without feeling like you're cheating.

This mod is a rewrite of cdaragorn's UIInfoSuite mod (which is baced on Demiacle's UiModSuite), so 99% of the credit goes to those guys. My contribution started after the December of 2019, when the original project became abandoned. As this is a very useful mod, I wanted to continue providing support for newer game verions, fixing bugs and adding new requested features, so here we are!

The current features include:
- Display an icon that represents the current days luck
- Display experience point gains
- Display a dynamic experience bar that changes based on your current tool or location
- Display more accurate heart levels
- Display more information on item mouse overs, including items that are still needed for bundles
- View calendar and quest billboard anywhere
- Display icons over animals that need petting
- Display crop type and days until harvest
- Display icon when animal has item yield (milk, wool)
- Sprinkler, scarecrow, beehive and junimo hut ranges
- Display npc locations on map
- Skip the intro by pressing the Escape key
- Display an icon for Queen of Sauce when she is airing a recipe you don't already know
- Display an icon when Clint is upgrading one of your tools. Icon will tell you how long until the tool is finished and shows you which tool you are upgrading.
- Display an icon for items that can be donated to the museum for the Complete Collection achievement
- Display an icon for items that can be shipped for the Full Shipment achievement
- Display an icon for the next day's weather conditions
- ... and also a new tab added to the options menu that allows turning each individual mod on or off whenever you want.

Compatibility is assured with:
- Bigger Backpack by spacechase0
- Level Extender by DevinLematty (probably?)
