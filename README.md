# UI Info Suite 2
_Ongoing maintenance for the original UI Info Suite mod for Stardew Valley._


UI Info Suite provides helpful information about things around you designed to help you be aware of what's going on without feeling like you're cheating.

This mod is a rewrite of cdaragorn's UIInfoSuite mod (which is baced on Demiacle's UiModSuite), so 99% of the credit goes to those guys. My contribution started after the December of 2019, when the original project became abandoned. As this is a very useful mod, I wanted to continue providing support for newer game verions, fixing bugs and adding new requested features, so here we are!

The current features include:
- Display an icon that represents the current days luck
- Display experience point gains
- Display a dynamic experience bar that changes based on your current tool or location
- Display more accurate heart levels
- Display more information on item mouse overs, including items that are still needed for bundles
- View calendar and quest billboard anywhere
- Display icons over animals that need petting
- Display crop type and days until harvest
- Display icon when animal has item yield (milk, wool)
- Sprinkler, scarecrow, beehive and junimo hut ranges
- Display npc locations on map
- Skip the intro by pressing the Escape key
- Display an icon for Queen of Sauce when she is airing a recipe you don't already know
- Display an icon when Clint is upgrading one of your tools. Icon will tell you how long until the tool is finished and shows you which tool you are upgrading.
- Display an icon for items that can be donated to the museum for the Complete Collection achievement
- Display an icon for items that can be shipped for the Full Shipment achievement
- Display an icon for the next day's weather conditions
- ... and also a new tab added to the options menu that allows turning each individual mod on or off whenever you want.

Known issues:
- In multiplayer only the host can see the correct location of NPC's on the map. If you face this issue, use the mod NPC Map Locations by Bouhm, which solves this problem. As it is a mod specialized for extending the map, it gets priority before UI Info Suite 2 and disables this mod's map features!

Compatibility is assured with:
- NPC Map Locations by Bouhm (gets priority before UI Info Suite 2 and disables this mod's map features)
- Bigger Backpack by spacechase0
- Level Extender by DevinLematty (probably?)
